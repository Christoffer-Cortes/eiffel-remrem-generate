__IMPORTANT NOTICE:__ The contents of this repository currently reflect a __DRAFT__. The Eiffel framework has been used in production within Ericsson for several years to great effect; what is presented here is a revision and evolution of that framework - an evolution that is currently ongoing. In other words, anything in this repository should be regarded as tentative and subject to change. It is published here to allow early access and trial and to solicit early feedback.
